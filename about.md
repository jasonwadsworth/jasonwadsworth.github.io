I'm a software enthusiast. I love solving problems and finding new, and better ways to do things. Some refer to me as a work-aholic, but I like to think I'm just someone who enjoys what I do.

I've been an AWS user since 2011, and love the innovation they provide. It's great to see a company that understands what it means to innovate, while also being the primary means of allowing others to do just that.

I'm also a big Microsoft guy. I have used MS tools since the Visual Basic 4 days, and love the tools they provide. I'm especially a fan of the modern Microsoft, including .Net Core.

I play in a lot of spaces, but my passion is helping teams build great products at a fast pace. I am a huge believer in DevOps and modern Agile (I think of them as one).
