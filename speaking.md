Looking for a speaker for your user group or conference? Let me know! I've spoken at several conferences across the country and love sharing what I've learned with others. I love talking about Serverless, SaaS, and even a little security (though I'll always defer to the experts on that).

### Upcoming Events

_Nothing scheduled. I'd love to come speak at your event._
